# What is our project? 
Our project is gatorride. A website that allows students to carpool and share the cost of rides. This can be used for club meeting carpools, weekend trips home, or away games. This solution will allow students to exchange services and connect with one another. Students who have cars can sign up to be “drivers” and they can submit a posting saying where they are going and how many seats are available. There will also be a feature that allows users to split the price of gas for the trip. 
tldr: GatorRide is a ride-sharing service for UF students
